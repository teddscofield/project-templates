Template Projects
=================
Various project templates I've found helpful when wanting to try ideas out quickly... ok, there's only one here for now.  So sue me *grin*


basic-webpage
-------------
My own starter webpage I've been using to jumpstart experimentation with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  The javascript libraries are all development versions since I do not read minified.  If you are able to easily, you need to get laid.  Versions listed here are "at least" version meaning I'm lazy and will probably forget to update this README when I update the copy of the library.

So far, here are the fixings:

  * index.html - (hopefully) correct markup usage
  * jQuery - 1.8.2
  * underscore - 1.4.2
  * backbone - 0.9.2
  * reset.css - 2.0


Coming Soon...
--------------
... maybe.  If I decide I care enough.  But anyway, some templates I may throw together:

  * PhoneGap
    A starter PhoneGap (Cordova) project for Android, iOS and possibly others.  Would like to crystalize the directory and file structure with verbose documentation to explain reasoning, common workflow, pitfalls, etc.  Would serve as a good home for some starter styling.

  * SpringMVC
    A SpringMVC project that renders JSON, XML, RSS in addition to desktop and mobile web views.

  * Spring Data Service
    Just like the MVC project but with emphasis on server-side technologies dealing with persistance and transactions.  So JPA (Hibernate), JMS, JTA

  * Maven POM's and ant scripts
    Everything from global settings I like to common dependencies, project structures and archtypes.
