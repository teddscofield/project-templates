Template Projects
=================
Various project templates I've found helpful when wanting to try ideas out quickly... ok, there's only one here for now.  So sue me *grin*


basic-webpage
-------------
My own starter webpage I've been using to jumpstart experimentation with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  The javascript libraries are all development versions since I do not read minified.  If you are able to easily, you need to get laid.  Versions listed here are "at least" version meaning I'm lazy and will probably forget to update this README when I update the copy of the library.

So far, here are the fixings:

  * index.html - (hopefully) correct markup usage
  * jQuery - 1.8.2
  * underscore - 1.4.2
  * backbone - 0.9.2
  * reset.css - 2.0
